# The Goal

The goal is to recreate the HUD from Command & Conquer: Renegade as completely as possible in Garry's Mod by porting the relevant portions of the original game's source code to Lua.

# File List

The core of the HUD lives in `Code/Combat/hud.cpp/h` which depends on:

<details>
    <summary>
        Files to be fully or partially ported to Lua

# Breaking the HUD down

The HUD is made up of a few discrete sections within `Code/Combat/hud.cpp`:

* Powerup Notification Feed
* Weapon Info
* HUD Help Text
* Weapon Chart Display
* Damage Indicator
* Target Display
* Objective Display
* Info Display
* Reticles

## Powerup Notification Feed

    ([`POWERUP_TIME`](https://github.com/A1steaksa/CnC_Renegade/blob/d0e4fde48468faee2ea84e35c21874647a5bbded/Code/Combat/hud.cpp#L311))
, its opacity begins to fade and all icons above it slide downward to replace it.

The left list contains notifications of new objectives, health and armor upgrades, and map visibility updates.

The right list contains health, armor, weapon, and ammo pickup notifications.

Each list item is comprised of:
* The name of the item or objective that was acquired
* A numerical quantity called "number" or "count" in the original code. (Visible on the right list only)
* The icon for the item or objective called "texture" in the original code. (Vertex colored green on the right list)
